# Reddit-But-Better
Have you ever scrolled past a meme without upvoting and felt bad? Well this is the solution for people like you! RedditButBetter uses computer vision to scan your emotions and upvotes posts if you like what you're seeing.


Aight to to get started, make a venv or conda env and install all the required modules and libraries. A requirements.txt will be added later.

Once you've done all that boring stuff, run redditbutbetter.py. This should work on a mac, however if you don't have a mac, that's too bad. Maybe we will release future support!

*Note: you might have to tweak the pyautogui click coordinates a bit depending on your computer to make it click on the right spot. I have a retina MBP (pre-2016).

The project may be stupid, but it was fun to write!
